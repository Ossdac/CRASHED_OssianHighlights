Project Scripts Overview
Introduction
This repository contains a curated selection of scripts from a larger game development project I contributed to. The primary intent of sharing these scripts is to illustrate my skills and experiences as a game programmer.

Disclaimer
The scripts in this repository were part of a collaborative effort and designed to function within a specific game framework. As a result, many of them rely on other components and systems from the original project. They are not intended to be used as independent modules in other projects. The purpose of sharing these scripts is to demonstrate my approach to coding and problem-solving within the context of a team-based game development environment.

Highlight: Labyrinth Optimization
A key highlight in this collection is the "Labyrinth Optimization" set of scripts (BlockDataManager.cs, BlockHelper.cs, etc.). These scripts showcase my ability to optimize game mechanics, specifically in the context of generating and managing labyrinth structures within the game. They stand as an example of my capabilities in terms of efficient coding and algorithm development.

Other Scripts
The repository also includes various other scripts (DestroyOnTeleport.cs, EventStarter.cs, Ship.cs, etc.) that cover different aspects of game development such as event handling, teleportation mechanics, and ship functionality. While these scripts provide insight into the breadth of my programming skills, they may not be fully functional outside their original context due to dependencies on other parts of the game.

Usage and Acknowledgments
These scripts are meant for portfolio review and demonstration purposes only. If you wish to use or adapt any of these scripts, please be mindful of their context and the collaborative nature of the original project. Avoid using this content in a way that might inadvertently claim credit for work that was part of a team effort.

Contact
For any inquiries, discussions, or questions about these scripts, feel free to reach out. I welcome your feedback and am open to discussing potential collaborations or opportunities.
